        <p>I describe myself as a simple girl yet dedicated towards my dreams.Since childhood, I am fascinated with computers
            and the wonders created by them.With growing age, my interest towards computeres turned into passion to persue My
            career in this field.So I have done my Bachelors in Computer Science and decided to do my Masters also in this
            field.

        <h1>Guardians of the Galaxy 2</h1>
        <p>The film contains great visuals, soundtrack, humor, and performances. My favorite character in the movie is Baby
            Groot which is goofy and adorable. It retains the look and tone of the original, replete with semi-crude humor,
            heartfelt moments, and bombastic action pieces. At the same time, it gives us an entirely new story without
            rehashing too much of the first film's narrative formula.
