            This Poodle and Boxer combination creates a pup that’s at once playful and serious, goofy and noble—the Boxerdoodle!
            This mixed breed has all of the best qualities of each parent, which means you’ll often end up with a loyal,
            protective, and energetic companion to pass your time with. Boxerdoodles are sensitive and sweet, and will truly
            thrive with the help of time, affection, and support from you.
